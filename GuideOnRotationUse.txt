*** MORE IN DEPTH EXPLANATION

Get all files needed ready into your correct folder that is named properly on your desktop
Step Up "rolespplneeded" excel file with the roles and number people needed and with stations ready 
for easy copy and paste usage later. Also edit "runforroles" file for what people you want to pre-assign a role
	- remember to put an "x" next in exclusions if you pre-assign a role 

Get the people that have clocked in from FCLM ASAP. Start retrieving the data as soon as it hit 7 AM or 7:01 AM
	- Download the file and name it as "tdyatt" and change the format to Excel Workbook
	- MAKE SURE IT IS NAMED PROPERLY AND IN THE RIGHT FOLDER
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open up Windows Terminal

Now we want to move to the folder of the files so type in the following commands:
	- "cd Desktop" then hit TAB and then hit ENTER
	- next type in "cd 'the foldername'" then hit TAB and then hit ENTER

Now that we are in the folder directory we can run the program using the command:
	- "python3 ibrolerun" then hit TAB and then hit ENTER

The code should now run and do as follows! Make sure the excel file is named "runforrole" and
that the file has the correct format. When running the code do NOT have the excel sheet open else
code will not run!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Follow the steps given on the screen. 

If it is the start of shift then type in "Y" when prompted or if it is for after lunch then
type "N"

If you type "N" the code should be done and the rotations are complete and you can open the excel sheet

If you type in "Y" is will ask if you want to reset the decant hours. You can say "Y" or "N" for the answer
REMEMBER: the code is case sensative else it will not run properly!

IF ANY ERRORS COME UP WHILE RUNTIME, CLOSE THE TERMINAL, MAKE SURE THE EXCEL FILE IS CORRECT AND PROPER NAME,
RESTART THE TERMINAL AND PROCEED FROM STEP 1!

When done you can transfer the needed information from "runforrole" excel sheet to "scanforrole" excel
sheet. 
DO NOT MAKE ANY EDITS IN THE "runforrole" SHEET, ALL EDITS SHALL BE DONE IN "scanforrole"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set up the laptop with the TV and ready to be scanned in by assoicates

If there are multiple computers send a list of all the scanned in people and pasted them into the
"comparinglists" excel sheet and run the macro. The people highlighted didn't scan their badge!
Make sure you had "scanforrole" scanned tab all cleared before use!

Everything should be done! Make sure everything is saved and ready for next time use!
